Realt-T enables your Landlord client to rent out an apartment to a tenant in a TRUSTLESS manner.
The Real-T smart contract is based on a ERC-1155 token that is ownable.
The tenant can do this blockchain transaction by paying either in currency or in cryptocurrency. The Landlord gets a receipt which is held in a virtual contract;
To illustrate:  I give you the digital entry key which comes to you by a specified date. The blockchain releases a refund if the key doesn’t come on time.
If I send the key before the rental date, the function holds it, releasing both the fee and key to you and me respectively when the date arrives.
The system works on the If-Then premise and is witnessed by hundreds of people, so you can expect a faultless delivery.
If I give you the key, I’m sure to be paid. If you send a certain amount in currency or cryptocurrency, you receive the key. The document is automatically canceled after the allotted time, and the code cannot be interfered with by either of us without the other knowing, since all participants are simultaneously alerted.
You can use smart contracts for all sorts of situations ranging from:
financial derivatives
insurance premiums
breach contracts
property law
credit enforcement
financial services
legal processes
crowdfunding agreements.
